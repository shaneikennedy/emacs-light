# Emacs (light) - my lightweight emacs config with only the necessities.
Ok and a few nice things, too.

I wanted to keep this as simple as possible to it is a 1-file config that is split by comments. 95% of the config I would consider essential and the other 5% is by taste. 

For the nice things I've put everything below the `;; Being improvements` comment. This consists of a nice window management package called "ace-window", a package called "smex" for sorting the M-x menu, and "evil-mode" because I am a sinner.

## Installing
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/shaneikennedy/emacs-light ~/emacs-light
ln -s ~/emacs-light/init.el ~/.emacs
```
